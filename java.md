#Folder 1
001 introduction
02 download and installation of JDK
Learnt that JDK houses the JRE and the JVM...JRE contains java class library + JVM
JVM is part of the JRE 
JDV is for developing
JVM is for executing java classes

03 
Using cmd to compile a simple program using the cd/ to move into a directory,dir to check its content...

04
learnt the use of java.lang.*; annotation

05 Exploring first java
 Was able to create a java program using the cmd command to create and move into the files and view 

06 Reaading from the keyboard
Introduced the use of scanner to make input from the keyboard and its been returned with an output

07 Reading with scanner
Learnt the use of scanner in details and also the nextln to move to the next line

08 Student challenge
I was able to write a program that asked for my name,after input,then an output of "how are you......."followed with the name inputed

#Folder 2
Data Types - Variables and literals
learnt primitive datatypes are:
  Integral-byte,short,int,long
  Floating point- float,double
  Char
  Boolean

variable defined:
Variable are names given to data,also they are used for storing data..a variable must have some data types
  for example:
byte c = 5
byte- data type
c -variable
5 -value
 Literals are constant values that are used in a program

#folder 3
Installations simplified

#folder 4
Features and Architecture
difference between compiler and interpreter simplified:
  Compiler and Interpreter are used to translate our programmes into machine code and also getting them executed.
- Interpreter reads the code line by line and translate while the compiler would read and prepare a translation file (or txt)
_ Intepreter translates over and over again while compiler does it once.

Java is platform independent
i learnt how files are converted from bytecode into machine code and its been done by the JVM using the interpreter and also the just-in-time compiler.
Then this is executed on the hardware.

#folder 5
hands-on sessions were done..a lot was learnt

#folder 6
detailed exxplanations of the return types
example:
   int length ()
   string toLowercase()
   string toUppercase()
   string trim()
...and lots more,explains how they can determine our output.
