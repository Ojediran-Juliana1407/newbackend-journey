Version control system
#A Version Control System (VCS)
 is software that helps track changes to files over time, maintaining a history of revisions. Git is one of the most popular distributed version control systems. Here are some common Git commands:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

git clone [url]: Copies an existing Git repository from a remote server to your local machine.

git add [file]: Adds a file to the staging area, preparing it to be committed.

git commit -m "[message]": Commits changes in the staging area to the repository with a descriptive message.

git status: Shows the status of files in the working directory and staging area.

git diff: Displays the differences between changes in the working directory and the staging area.

git push: Sends committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository.

git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local branch.

git branch: Lists all local branches in the repository.

git checkout [branch]: Switches to a different branch.

git merge [branch]: Combines changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

git log: Displays a history of commits in the repository.
