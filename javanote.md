# Folder 7- Conditional Statement
 Operators are in 2 forms:
- Relational Operators
They are used for comparing the values or data types, they return boolean data types that is true/false.
- Logical operators

    Conditional Statement
They are statement that are executed based on the value of a condition,that is true/false.
1. If condition
2. Nested if
3. Else if ladder
     switch cases are mostly used for developing menu driven program
N:B Codes written would be attached in another file

# Folder 8  Loops
1. While loop
2. Do-while loop
3. For loop
4. For each loop

While loop will continue its iteration as far as the condition is true,it checks the condition before execution.
Do-while loop executes the block before checking for the condition.
Infinite loop keeps iterating,it never stops.

# Folder 9   Arrays
An Array is a collection of similar data elements
Every array is an object in java,and every array in java is created in the heap.
 Array has a property or field,that is length of an array.Every object of an array has a length.
 Counter control for loop is used for modifying 

* 2-dimensional array
-metrics
-Table of data

* Jagged Array

#Folder 10  Methods
Methods are members of classes which provides functionality for the class.Method are called instead of function in object oriented programming.
its written as:
  returnType  methodName (parameter list)
-returnType can be referred to as the header/signature of the method
-parameter list is the input taken by a method.

* Parameters passed in the method called are actual parameters
* Parameters of a called method are formal parameters,they are input to a method.

-Primitive are passed by value
-objects are passed by reference

Method Overloading:is creating multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameters.
 For example:
int max(int x,,int y)
float max(float x,float y)
int max(int x ,int y, int v)

   Variable Argument varargs
void show (int...x)
...indicates variable argumment

# Folder 11    Object Oriented Programming
Principles of OOP are:
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
